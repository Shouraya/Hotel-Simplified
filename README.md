# Hotel-Simplified #
Hello Everyone, I am initiating project for the following reason : <br/><br/>
When someone goes to a city maybe for the purpose of entertainment or maybe for purpose of their childâ€™s college admission or maybe to visit their child in his hostel. Then he/she has to see many websites and find an appropriate place for his night stay, and he may not like the place. We want to create an appropriate platform where there is a one stop solution.
The user (parent/child/teacher/anyone) has to just post a picture of his stay and other users could also comment/share their review over that particular place and dynamic pricing feature could help them book their place.

## Motivation ##
I am initiating this project as a part of Software Engineering Project.

## Stack Used ##
M - MongoDB \
E - Express <br/>
N - Node.js <br/>
